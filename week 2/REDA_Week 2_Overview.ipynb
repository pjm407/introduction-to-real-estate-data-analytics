    "* This lecture introduces you to important concepts that allow us to operationalize ideas in data analytics, such as **probability distributions** and **data generating processes**.\n",
    "    * **We will build these ideas be constructed from two exhibits from a prominent textbook in Real Estate Finance**.\n",
    "    * We will distinguish between *probability theory* and *applied statistics*.  \n",
    "    * Ideally, this lecture will provide you greater grounding in empirical finance.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In turn, we deploy a logically-consistent method to explore conjectures about the world using data and algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Painful but **necessary**.\n",
    "    * We should pay respect for the considerable history that has brought us here.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Chairman Bernanke conjectured that a **global savings glut** limited his abiility to address a housing bubble in the U.S. because the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates had broken down.\n",

    "* Many **CRE** professionals claimed that long-duration rates would rise after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n",
    "    * One Senior Economic Advisor said that rates would be \"back above 5%\".\n",
    "    * This was deemed at the time to be **thought leadership**.\n",
    "    * The expressed concern was a potential impact on cap rates.\n",
    "    * A simple examination of data **at the time** would have suggested the likelihood was low."
