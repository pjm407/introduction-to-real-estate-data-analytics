# REDA1-CE1000: Introduction to Real Estate Data Analytics

## Week 2: Foundational Concepts, Part 1
  - Probability and Statistics
  - Hypothesis Testing

* Purpose
  - This lecture introduces you to important concepts that allow us to operationalize ideas in data analytics, such as probability distributions and data generating processes.
  - We will build these ideas be constructed from two exhibits from a prominent textbook in Real Estate Finance.
  - We will distinguish between probability theory and applied statistics.
  - Ideally, this lecture will provide you greater grounding in empirical finance.
    
* In turn, we deploy a logically-consistent method to explore conjectures about the world using data and algorithms.

* Painful but necessary.
  - We should pay respect for the considerable history that has brought us here.
  - And these ideas should complement your understanding of real estate finance.


## The Role of the Conjecture

* The Bernanke Conjecture: A Global Savings Glut
  - Ben Bernanke, Ph.D. takes over from Alan Greenspan, Ph.D. in 2006.
  - Chairman Bernanke conjectured that a global savings glut limited his abiility to address a housing bubble in the U.S. because the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates had broken down.
    - Liquidity Preference Theory or Expectations Theory.
    - But at its core, this is an empirical claim.
    - One that could have been explored at the time it was made.
    
* An Election Conjecture: Thought Leadership
  - Many CRE professionals claimed that long-duration rates would rise after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
    - One Senior Economic Advisor said that rates would be "back above 5%".
    - This was deemed at the time to be thought leadership.
    - The expressed concern was a potential impact on cap rates.
    - A simple examination of data at the time would have suggested the likelihood was low.

* We will now take a detour to lay the foundation of statistics. We will return to these conjectures next week and examine them again though a framework of statistical hypothesis testing.
