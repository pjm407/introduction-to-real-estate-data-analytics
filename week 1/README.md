# REDA1-CE1000: Introduction to Real Estate Data Analytics

## Week 1: Course Introduction and Overview

## Course Introduction and Overview
* About Me
    - Data Analyst
    - Studied Applied Quantitative Research and Public Policy at NYU

* Perspective
    - Like every other industry, CRE will be disrupted by the application of technology empowered by data analytics.
    - It will be called different things, but it is the same thing.
        - Econometrics and forecasting
        - Statistical learning
        - Machine learning
        - Artificial intelligence (not really)
    
* Why?
    - Predict the 10-Year U.S. Treasury to determine a realistic DCF for my property.
    - Predict the cap rate on this property based on its characteristics.
    - Predict how likely my current tenant is to churn at the end of her lease term - and whether I can intervene to affect the decision.
    - Predict how labor costs will change over time.
    - Given the current interest rate environment, demand for hard assets like CRE is strong. Algorithmic deployment of capital.
        - The same thing happened with bond and equity trading.


* My Goals
    - Develop a common language among us through rapid immersion.
        - Exploring conjectures about the world (without data, this is now called "thought leadership").
        - Time series as storytelling and for forecasting.
        - Examples of when algorithms fail and considerations about causation.
    - Introduce you to R and R Studio to rapidly expand your tool kit.
        - Provide historical background in probability and statistics.
        - R is a low-level programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence R).
    - I will be using Jupyter notebooks (as a substitute for PowerPoint).
        - Occasional use of Python graphics in class.
        - Visualizations and Monte Carlo methods rather than mathematical proofs.

* Why R and R Studio?
    - Stable code base and platform
    - Open source and free
    - Learning curve is not steep, allowing for immediate immersion in data acquisition and analysis
    - Compatible with other statistical learning environment, and this class is focused on ideas (not necessarily tools)
    - Open source and free

* Course Logistics
    - Provide you with many examples from a variety of sources, including real estate and finance.
    - Weekly lectures with multiple examples, together with graded weekly assignments.
    - By the end of this class, you will know more about data analysis than the chief economists of either CBRE or JLL.
    - Never forget: If I can do this, so can you. And you'll be more efficient, productive professionals.


* Prominent CRE Brokerage Forecast for 2020 (in December 2019)
    - Fed Funds target rate of 1.25% or 125 basis points (bps).
    - "Good, not great" output growth.
    - Slight decline in capitalization rates 
    - Slightly higher real estate values.

* Concurrent Forecast Errors
    - FOMC had already lowered its target rate by 40% to 1.5% during 2019.
    - Inconsistent with a forecast of 1.25%.
* Long-term interest rates fell substantially during 2019 with the 10-year U.S. Treasury declining by 30%.
    - Reflecting slowing output growth.
* Yield curve (10-year minus 3-month) was below 50 bps and had been falling since 2017.
    - It was negative for substantial portions of 2019: Professor Campbell Harvey's recession predictor.
* In other words, the predictions were not consistent with the economic data at the time the predictions were made.
    - Live by the forecast, die by the forecast error.
* One might call this the state of artificial intelligence in commercial real estate.

* In Truth, There Is No AI
    - For the difficult questions that we face in CRE, there is no artificial intelligence.
    - We have tools, and you must put the human back into machine learning.
    - You must think about relationships given your domain knowledge in real estate.
        - Finance: Can you predict interest rates or cap rates?
        - Development: Can you predict labor costs?

* An Introduction to R and R Studio
    - Access to a massive collection of algorithms, especially time-series, and datasets
    - Tool to implement ideas
        - Present Discounted Value: It's a built-in function in Excel, but why do we discount?

* R and R Studio
    - Installing and loading libraries
    - CRAN, task views, and R vignettes
    - Graphics and story telling
    - Linear regression
    - Dataframes as spreadsheets
    - Application Protocol Interfaces (APIs)
    - Webscrapping
    - Feature engineering (data manipulation)
    - Practical examples
